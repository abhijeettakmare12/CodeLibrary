# jQuery PlugIns

#### Notes on jQuery Plugins

Adding jQuery often follows the following few steps:


1. Include jQuery. [See here](https://github.com/bappygolder/CodeLibrary/blob/master/03.%20jQuery.md)
2. Attach the plugin's css file (best practice is to attach the CSS file before the site's main css file. That way it is easy to override.)
3. Attache the JavaScript file of the plugin
4. Structure the HTML
5. Add your own JavaScript
6. Select an element on the page useing jQuery
7. Call the plugin function. Calling the plugin can be as simple as the example billow. 

For Example
```
<script>
	$(".animsition").animsition();
</script>
```
