# jQuery PlugIns

#### jQuery Plugins and Notes on jQuery Plugins

Adding jQuery often follows the following few steps:

1. Attach jQuery. [See here](https://github.com/bappygolder/CodeLibrary/blob/master/03.%20jQuery.md)
1. Attach the plugin's css file
-- best practice is to attach the CSS file before the site's main css file. That way it is easy to override.
