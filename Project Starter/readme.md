# About: Project Starter Folder

This folder contains a brand new website starter project. This folder gives a quick start to new website/web projects. 

## Resources
- [Mark Down Editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor) (To edit this document)

## Getting Started / Usage

- Download the project
- Remove this document named ` readme.md ` and located in the project root
- Start coading


## The Vision

- The goal of this folder is to have all the necessary files, folder structure and plugins included and ready to use. 
- The user will simply have to remove unnecessary files, folders and plugins to get started. 
- We will have to try our best to only include commonly used standerd files, folders and code so that this project remains a lightweight project starting point. 
- We only have a few things included now but our goal will be to continue adding more commonly used assets. 

Feel free to suggest or add new things. 

### Further Into The Future

Perhaps we can work towards creating a solution where users can click and choose what they want included in their project starter and we can customize the project before they download and get stared.
